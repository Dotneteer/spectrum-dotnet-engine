# Developing a ZX Spectrum Emulator in .NET (C#)

When you surf the internet for ZX Spectrum retro computer emulators, you can find a few dozen of them. Most of them are high-fidelity, and you can find many with the complete source code.

ZX Spectrum was one of my favorite computers in my childhood. It was my second one (I got it one year after my ZX 81), and I used it during my secondary school years. I guess the experience I obtained while programming my Speccy was one of the main reasons I became a software engineer.

I've been working as a commonsense coach in the last tenish years, teaching teams to develop software more productively. About five years ago, I decided to develop a ZX Spectrum emulator in C# to use the project's source code as a solid base to teach software testing principles. Since that time, I have created several versions of the emulator, including TypeScript and WebAssembly versions.

The most challenging part of creating the emulator was to gather all the information about the hardware (and its internals) that I needed to create the software pieces that provided the same feeling I had when holding the Speccy in my hand. Some hardware components were easy to simulate, while others meant suffering.

While working on those projects, I learned many valuable tricks and approaches. I decided to share most of them and allow anyone to develop their retro computer emulator using what I understood.
